I'm **Jen Bradley**, a PhD researcher studying colloidal self-assembly through the lens of molecular simulation. I place a particular focus on the role of particle geometry in assembling and stabilizing complex phases.

Here are a few of my projects!

### janbridley/svg3d

A modern refactor of an older package used to generate vector art from systems of convex polyhedra. This can be used for high-quality visualizations of single geometries as well as simulations of faceted nanoparticles.

TODO: Twisted pentagonal prisms building into icosahedron: 5akis pentagonal antiprism

TODO: simulation frame - should be high density (near perfect) - maybe quasicrystal, use shading for sure.

### glotzerlab/coxeter

Performant, transferrable computational geometry code for shapes in two and three dimensions.

TODO: point in polyhedron around the outside, plus some visualization of common properties: equation for volume computation, inertia tensor?


TODO: smaller side projects: one goofy "for the love of it" project and maybe one simulation one? Could be something else as well
