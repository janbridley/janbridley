I'm **Jen Bradley**, a PhD researcher studying colloidal self-assembly through the lens of molecular simulation. I place a particular focus on the role of particle geometry in assembling and stabilizing complex phases.

Here are a few of my projects!

### janbridley/svg3d

A modern refactor of an older package used to generate vector art from systems of convex polyhedra, updated to better fit the scope of simulation science. This can be used for high-quality visualizations of single geometries as well as compact renderings of faceted nanoparticles.

<!--- TODO: Twisted pentagonal prisms building into icosahedron: 5akis pentagonal antiprism --->

<!--- TODO: simulation frame - should be high density (near perfect) - maybe quasicrystal, use shading for sure. --->

### glotzerlab/coxeter

Performant, transferrable computational geometry code for shapes in two and three dimensions.

<!--- TODO: point in polyhedron around the outside, plus some visualization of common properties: equation for volume computation, inertia tensor? --->


<!--- TODO: smaller side projects: one goofy "for the love of it" project and maybe one simulation one? Could be something else as well --->
