I'm **Jen Bradley**, a PhD researcher studying colloidal self-assembly through the lens of molecular simulation. I place a particular focus on the role of particle geometry in assembling and stabilizing complex phases.



Here are a few of my projects!

### glotzerlab/coxeter

Performant, transferrable computational geometry code for shapes in two and three dimensions.
